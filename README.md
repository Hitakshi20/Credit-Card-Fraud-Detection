# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
<p>A Data Analysis and Visualization Project using Python</p>

### Overview -
In an increasingly digital and interconnected world, the use of credit cards has grown, providing convenience and flexibility in financial transactions. This convenience, however, comes with a big disadvantage: the ever-present potential for credit card fraud. 
Credit card fraud is a pervasive problem that affects cardholders and financial institutions worldwide. Traditional methods of fraud detection, while effective to some extent, often fall short in the face of evolving fraud tactics. As fraudulent activities continue to adapt and grow, the need for an effective fraud detection system has never been more critical.

### The goal of the project -
The main goal of this project will be to identify and prevent unauthorized or fraudulent transactions effectively and efficiently. The objective of this project is to improve credit card transaction security by developing an advanced fraud detection system, thereby minimizing financial losses due to unauthorized activities, and to improve operational efficiency within financial institutions by automating and optimizing the fraud detection process.

### Dataset 
**Source:** The dataset is from the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/data).

**Features:** The dataset consists of 35742 transactions with 31 features, including:

**Time:** Seconds elapsed between the first transaction and this transaction.

**V1 to V28:** Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transformed features.

**Amount:** Transaction amount.

**Class:** Target variable (1 for fraudulent, 0 for non-fraudulent).

### Results
The final model achieved the following results:

**Accuracy on Training Set:** 82.0%

**Accuracy on Testing Set:** 80.0%
